# inventory-sim-py
A realistic multi-echelon inventory simulator that models demand forecasting, supply lead times, stock management, and cost dynamics across a three-tier supply chain (supplier → warehouse → factory). Built in Python using numpy, matplotlib. this simulation helps evaluate inventory policies under uncertain demand and supply conditions.
